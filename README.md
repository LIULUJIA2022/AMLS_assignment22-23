Student Number: 22126076

## This project tackles four different classification problems:

#### Task A1 - Gender Classification in Human Facial Images
#### Task A2 - Emotion Classification in Human Facial Images
#### Task B1 - Face-Shape Classification in Cartoon Facial Images
#### Task B2 - Eye-Colour Classification in Cartoon Facial Images

### AMLS_22-23_SN17011729 folder contains all the code for this project
Required Python3 version 3.6.9

## Libraries:
* Keras (v 2.3.1)
* Keras-Applications (v 1.0.8)
* Keras-Preprocessing (v 1.1.0)
* Matplotlib (v 3.1.2)
* Numpy (v 1.18.0)
* OpenCV-python (v 4.1.2.30)
* Pandas (v 0.25.3)
* scikit-learn (0.22.1)
* Tensorflow (v 2.0.0)
* dlib (v 19.19.0)
* tensorflow




## File Function
* preprocess.py: extract training ,validation and test data for task A1, A2, B1 and B2

* lab_landmarks.py: Contains facial landmarks extraction function for task A1 and A2

* shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat: Face recognition 68 feature points detection database

* main.py


## Jupyter notebook
In addition to the.py files described above (which are part of the main.py structure), I have included 4 Jupyter notebooks, which are intended to provide more detailed solutions for the project. They will describe the steps each algorithm is performing and compare the performance of different classifiers on the same specified task. The overall structure is simpler than main.py.
